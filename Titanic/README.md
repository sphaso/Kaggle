An attempt at Naive Bayes and Decision Tree by yours truly.     
The data science work (feature engineering, selection etc.) was taken from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/thilakshasilva/predicting-titanic-survival-using-five-algorithms) and [this](https://www.kaggle.com/ldfreeman3/a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy) kernels.    
Regarding Decision Tree, most of the code is a rehash of the relevant chapter of [this book](http://haskelldata.com/).
